## Overview

The **ICT Operations SMS Module** replaces Odoo’s default SMS IAP provider with a direct integration to **Africa’s Talking**, enabling reliable, cost-effective SMS delivery for internal university communication.

The module is designed specifically for institutional environments where:

- Internet access is restricted by firewalls
- Network reliability fluctuates
- Data protection and auditability are mandatory

It is suitable for use in:
- Student notifications
- ICT service alerts
- Administrative messaging
- Internal operational broadcasts

---

## Scope and Intended Use

This module is intended for **internal university deployment only**.

Primary users:
- ICT Administrators
- System Administrators
- Authorized Marketing / Communications staff

It is **not** designed for:
- Commercial bulk SMS resale
- External third-party tenant usage
- Personal or non-institutional messaging

---

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Direct SMS Gateway Integration**  
  Custom Python connector communicating directly with Africa’s Talking via REST API.

- **Sandbox and Production Modes**  
  Allows safe testing using Africa’s Talking Sandbox before switching to live production.

- **Administrator Test Messaging**  
  Uses the logged-in admin’s profile number for controlled gateway verification.

---

### Technical Resilience

- **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic**  
  Automatically retries failed requests during temporary network outages.

- **Firewall-Compatible SSL Handling**  
  Supports relaxed SSL verification for controlled internal university networks.

- **Phone Number Normalization**  
  Automatically converts Kenyan numbers into E.164 format  
  (`07xxxxxxxx` → `+2547xxxxxxxx`).

---

## Architecture

The module intercepts Odoo’s SMS dispatch flow and reroutes messages through the Africa’s Talking gateway.

    Send a test SMS

    Display:

        Success confirmation, or

        A detailed error message for diagnostics

No bulk messages are sent during testing.
Operational Notes (ICT Use)

    Always test in Sandbox Mode before switching to Production.

    Ensure user phone numbers are correctly stored in international format.

    Limit access to SMS configuration menus using Odoo ACLs.

    Monitor logs during high-volume campaigns.

Troubleshooting
SMS Not Sending

Possible causes:

    Incorrect API Key

    Wrong environment selected

    No internet access from the server

Solution:

    Verify credentials in SMS Gateway settings

    Test connection using Sandbox

    Check server outbound HTTPS access

SSL / Certificate Errors

Cause:

    University firewall performing SSL inspection

Solution:

    Confirm SSL handling is enabled in gateway settings

    Verify firewall rules allow HTTPS traffic to Africa’s Talking
